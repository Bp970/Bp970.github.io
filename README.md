As a recent graduate with a background in engineering and statistics, I am passionate about software development and love connecting ideas from different disciplines and teams. During my graduate studies, I took on several leadership roles, including mentoring undergraduate interns and coordinating institute-wide events, demonstrating my ability to lead and work collaboratively.


I am particularly interested in full-time software developer roles and have basic technical skills in Python, HTML, and CSS, as well as knowledge of SQL and R, and familiarity with LSTM. If you have any relevant opportunities or simply want to connect, feel free to contact me at 222bhaveshpatil@gmail.com.
